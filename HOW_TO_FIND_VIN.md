# How to Find a Vehicle's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)

## What is a VIN?
A VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is a unique 17-character code that identifies a specific vehicle. It's like a fingerprint for your car.

## Where to Find the VIN

### 1. **On the Vehicle Itself** (Most Common Locations)

#### Dashboard (Driver's Side)
- **Location:** Look through the windshield from outside the car
- **Position:** Bottom-left corner of the dashboard, visible from outside
- **Format:** Usually on a small metal plate or sticker

#### Driver's Door Jamb
- **Location:** Open the driver's door and look at the door frame
- **Position:** On a sticker or metal plate on the door pillar (B-pillar)
- **Contains:** VIN plus other vehicle information

#### Engine Block
- **Location:** Under the hood, on the engine
- **Position:** Stamped directly on the engine block
- **Note:** May be harder to see, might need to clean the area

#### Front Frame
- **Location:** Under the hood, on the front frame rail
- **Position:** Usually visible when looking at the engine bay

### 2. **Vehicle Documents**

#### Registration Certificate (Swedish: Registreringsbevis)
- The VIN is printed on your vehicle registration document
- Usually labeled as "Chassinummer" or "VIN" in Sweden

#### Insurance Documents

### 3. **Digital Sources**

## VIN Format

A VIN is always **17 characters** long and contains:
- **No letters I, O, or Q** (to avoid confusion with numbers 1 and 0)
- Mix of numbers (0-9) and letters (A-Z, except I, O, Q)
- Example: `YV1TS61P8K1234567`

## VIN Breakdown

The VIN contains encoded information:
- **Characters 1-3:** World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI)
- **Characters 4-8:** Vehicle Descriptor Section (VDS)
- **Character 9:** Check digit
- **Character 10:** Model year
- **Character 11:** Plant code
- **Characters 12-17:** Serial number

## Tips for Finding VIN

1. **Start with the dashboard** - Easiest location, visible from outside
2. **Check registration documents** - Most reliable source
3. **Use a flashlight** - Some locations may be hard to see
4. **Clean the area** - Dirt or rust may obscure the VIN
5. **Take a photo** - Helps avoid transcription errors

## Common Issues

### VIN Not Visible
